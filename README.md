# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delay Analysis using Azure, Databricks, Spark, & Power BI

This project analyzes U.S. domestic flight data to uncover trends in delays, cancellations, and airline performance using ETL processes. Data was processed using a Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture in Azure Databricks and visualized through interactive dashboards in Power BI.

## üöÄ Project Objectives

- Design a robust data ETL pipeline using medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- Clean, transform, and enrich raw flight data from a Kaggle dataset
- Analyze delay trends across airlines, dates, and locations
- Build Power BI dashboards to communicate insights effectively

## üß± Data Pipeline Architecture

üìÇ **Bronze Layer**  
- Raw ingestion of Kaggle flight delay data  
- No transformations, preserves original structure

üìÇ **Silver Layer**  
- Removes duplicates, canceled, and diverted flights  
- Standardizes timestamps, formats numeric columns  
- Adds features like `YearMonth`, `FlightDateTS`

üìÇ **Gold Layer**  
- Aggregates and prepares curated datasets for reporting  
- Multiple derived tables created for specific insights

## üìà Insights & Results

- Certain airlines have significantly higher average delays than others
- Some airports consistently face more delays than others
- January 2024 saw moderate daily delay fluctuation
- Majority of flights that are on-time vary widely between carriers

## üí° Personal Takeaways

This project enabled me to demonstrate the core concepts and skills I gained from earning the following certifications:

- **Databricks Certified Data Analyst Associate**  
  Leveraged Databricks and PySpark to clean, transform, and analyze large-scale flight data in a pipeline format.
  
- **Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate (PL-300)**  
  Created intuitive dashboards,  translated raw data into meaningful visualizations, and conveyed significant insights that can contribute to industrial decision-making.

- **Microsoft Certified: Fabric Analytics Engineer Associate (DP-600)**  
  Demonstrated abd experienced a robust comprehension of ELT pipelines, gold-layer modeling, and semantic layer preparation as covered by this certification. Designed a modern lakehouse architecture using Microsoft Fabric-compatible tools (Delta Lake, Data Lake Storage).

Another noteable takeaway- the hands-on experience regarding environment integration was an incredibly humbling process of learning, as this project was unguided. Specifically, the setup of a Microsoft Azure environment and an Azure databricks environment entailed transferring local data from Kaggle onto an Azure storage account and container, connecting to the data via Azure databricks, setting up a functional cluster for the notebook which required various configurations, then writing the dataframes to tables to be connected to via Power BI. This process quite daunting for the directionless, entry-level candidate who simply wished to work with data processing and data visualization. I experienced many shortcomings and dead-ends that demanded perseverance and adaptability, which are two attributes that cannot be accredited by a technical certification. 

Through this hands-on project, I strengthened my end-to-end data analytics workflow‚Äîfrom ingestion and transformation to visualization. It also helped me develop a deeper understanding of how to structure data for reporting, optimize queries, and design dashboards that effectively tell a story.
